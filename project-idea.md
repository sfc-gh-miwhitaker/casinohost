This project is a custom demo for a casino customer

They want to be able to provide dynamic guidance to hosts on the casino floor about players.  most importantly to understand who should get comps and what actions the host may perform to encourage the players to play longer through identification of trends.

- Build a comprehensive plan to do this as a 100% native snowflake solution
    - snowflake intelligence will be the interface the hosts will use
    - we need semantic views and agent configurations to support this interaction
    - we need to research how others have solved this problem and emulate in snowflake
    - we may end up using a combination of aisql and ML features, the goal is to showcase snowflake for this use case
    - we must provide a clear best practice example based on the latest documentation and features

Write in your questions below and I will fill in more detail:
